# Functional-Programming

## Basics of functional programming 

- Programming paradigm: A style or way of computer programming. Different languages support writing programs in different ways.

- Four major programming paradigms exist
   - Procedural
   - Object-orientated
   - Declarative
   - Functional
 
- Main features of Functional Programming:
   - Functions are used as the fundamental building blocks (unlike on other paradigms which allow objects, procedures etc. )
   - Statements are written as a series of functions.
   - Each accepts input data as arguments and returns an output.
   - **Statelessness & immutability**
       - Values of variables can not change
       - Variables are immutable
       - The program is stateless
   - **No side effects**
       - A function can only perform a calculation and return a value.
       - This results in code being much easier to write correctly.
       - Easier for the programmer to understand.
       - Easier to predict how the program will behave.
       - Less prone to bugs.
       - All this aids massively in writing programs which need to take advantage of **parallel processing**.
       - Makes functional programming ideal for processing **Big Data**.

  - In functional programming a function is considered a **first-class object*.
  - A first class object is an object which may:
    - Be assigned to a variable
    - Appear in expression
    - Be assigned as an argument
    - Be returned in a function call
  - First class objects we are already familiar with are:
    - Integers
    - Real/Float/Decimals
    - Characters
    - Strings
